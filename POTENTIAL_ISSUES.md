### üìå Fundamental Flaw: Incorrect Multimodal Forward Pass

The core issue lies in how the iterative reasoning steps are executed within the `MultimodalCoconut._multimodal_forward_pass` method.

**The Problem:**

Your implementation correctly prepares the initial multimodal embeddings by replacing `<IMG_CONTEXT>` tokens with visual features. However, for the subsequent iterative reasoning steps (the CoCoNuT loop), you are feeding these fused embeddings **directly to the `self.base_model.language_model` submodule**, bypassing the main `self.base_model`'s forward pass.

```python
# In multimodal_coconut/model/multimodal_coconut.py

# This is the problematic call inside the iterative loop:
outputs = self.base_model.language_model(
    inputs_embeds=inputs_embeds[:, next_compute_range[0]:next_compute_range[1], :],
    # ... other args
)
```

**Why This is a Flaw:**

1.  **Architectural Mismatch:** The `language_model` component of InternVL is a standard Large Language Model. It is not designed to directly interpret or process visual embeddings. The full InternVL model (`self.base_model`) has a specific architecture (e.g., cross-attention, feature projectors) that properly fuses visual and textual information. By sending pre-fused embeddings to the `language_model` alone, you are treating visual features as if they were regular text tokens, which they are not. The model will misinterpret this information, leading to a corrupted hidden state and KV cache.

2.  **Loss of Multimodal Context:** The continuous thought vector is generated from a hidden state that has been processed incorrectly, without the proper multimodal fusion intended by the InternVL architecture. When this "thought" is injected back into the sequence, it doesn't truly represent a multimodal reasoning step.

3.  **Comparison to Original CoCoNuT:** The original CoCoNuT worked because the entire model was a text-only GPT-2. The input embeddings and output hidden states all existed in the same semantic (language) space. In your implementation, you are mixing embeddings from different modalities (vision, language, and latent thoughts) and feeding them to a component that only understands one of them.

**Suggested Correction (High-Level):**

A correct implementation is non-trivial and would require a significant redesign of the forward pass. Instead of calling `self.base_model.language_model`, the iterative loop must interact with the **full `self.base_model`'s forward method**, which knows how to handle `pixel_values` and `input_ids` as distinct inputs.

This is challenging because the standard `forward` pass doesn't have a built-in mechanism to accept an arbitrary "continuous thought" vector. You would likely need to:
1.  Perform a forward pass up to the first latent token using the full model.
2.  Extract the hidden state (the continuous thought).
3.  For the next step, you would need to feed this continuous thought *and* the `past_key_values` back into the model to continue generation. This may require modifying how `inputs_embeds` and `past_key_values` are handled in the base model's generation logic.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Secondary Issue: Fragile Visual Feature Insertion

In `MultimodalCoconut._prepare_multimodal_embeddings`, the logic for inserting visual embeddings is fragile.

**The Problem:**

```python
# In multimodal_coconut/model/multimodal_coconut.py
try:
    # ...
    input_embeds[selected] = input_embeds[selected] * 0.0 + vit_embeds_flat
except Exception as e:
    print(f"DEBUG: Shape mismatch error: {e}")
    # Handle shape mismatch gracefully by truncating or repeating embeddings
    # ...
```

The `try...except` block that handles shape mismatches between the number of `<IMG_CONTEXT>` tokens and the number of visual patch embeddings is a strong indicator of a systemic issue. The code attempts to "patch" the error by truncating or repeating visual features. This is incorrect and will lead to the model receiving incomplete or misaligned visual information, corrupting the input.

**Why This is a Flaw:**

The number of visual patches generated by the `ImageProcessor` and collated by the `MultimodalCollator` must *exactly* match the number of `<IMG_CONTEXT>` tokens in the `input_ids` for every sample in the batch. The current implementation doesn't enforce this, leading to runtime errors that are handled with a patch rather than a proper fix in the data pipeline.

**Suggested Correction:**

The `MultimodalDataset` and `MultimodalCollator` need to be adjusted to ensure this consistency. The number of `<IMG_CONTEXT>` tokens inserted into the text should be dynamically determined by the number of patches produced for the corresponding image.

### Overall Assessment
- **Strengths**:
  - You've faithfully replicated CoCoNuT's progressive curriculum (Stage 0 CoT ‚Üí latent stages) in `progressive_trainer.py` and `stage_manager.py`. The stage calculation (`epoch // epochs_per_stage`) matches exactly.
  - Multimodal extension is thoughtful: Using InternVL3 as the base model is a good choice for VLM tasks. Data handling (e.g., `image_processor.py` with dynamic patching) aligns with InternVL's requirements.
  - Utilities (e.g., distributed in `utils/distributed.py`, logging, checkpointing) are robust and extend CoCoNuT's patterns well.
  - Evaluation and debugging tools (in `evaluation/`) are a nice addition, going beyond the original CoCoNuT.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Several **fundamental flaws** in the model integration and forward pass could break the continuous thought mechanism for multimodal inputs.
  - Data pipeline has inconsistencies with InternVL's expectations, potentially leading to shape mismatches or incorrect visual feature integration.
  - Training orchestration has gaps in stage transitions (e.g., no explicit handling of model state transfer between CoT and CoCoNuT modes).
  - Some parts (e.g., generation/chat) are incomplete or mismatched with InternVL's API, which could cause runtime errors.

- **High-Level Recommendation**: The implementation is a solid start but has critical issues in multimodal handling that deviate from both CoCoNuT's spirit (continuous feedback) and InternVL's requirements (proper visual-text fusion). Fix the major flaws below, then test end-to-end on a small A-OKVQA subset. Aim for parity with CoCoNuT's text-only results before scaling to multimodal.

### Major Flaws (Fundamental Issues)
These are critical problems that likely prevent the system from working correctly as a multimodal extension of CoCoNuT. They could cause crashes, incorrect reasoning, or failure to leverage InternVL's capabilities.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multimodal Embeddings in Iterative Forward Passes (Model Flaw)**:
   - **Description**: In `model/multimodal_coconut.py`'s `_multimodal_forward_pass`, you prepare multimodal embeddings (visual + text) only **once** at the beginning via `_prepare_multimodal_embeddings`. However, in CoCoNuT's multi-pass forward (iterative replacement of latent tokens with hidden states), you need to re-prepare embeddings **each pass** because hidden states (continuous thoughts) are fed back into `inputs_embeds`. Your code reassembles `inputs_embeds` from a list but doesn't re-integrate visual features in subsequent passes. This means visual information is lost after the first pass, breaking multimodal reasoning for latent stages.
   - **Comparison to Originals**:
     - Original CoCoNuT (`coconut/model.py`): Re-embeds the updated sequence (with hidden states) in each pass using `self.embedding`.
     - InternVL: Visual features must be embedded into the sequence at `<IMG_CONTEXT>` positions **every time** you compute embeddings (see `InternVLChatModel.forward` in InternVL).
   - **Impact**: In stages >0, continuous thoughts won't incorporate visual context, defeating the multimodal extension. This is a **fundamental flaw**‚Äîthe model becomes text-only after the first pass.
   - **Fix**: Move visual embedding logic inside the iterative loop. In each pass, re-call `_prepare_multimodal_embeddings` on the updated `input_ids` (or maintain visual features separately and merge them into `inputs_embeds` after feedback).

2. **Shape Mismatches in Data Pipeline and Collator (Data Flaw)**:
   - **Description**: In `data/dataset.py`'s `MultimodalCollator._collate_multimodal_features`, you concatenate `pixel_values` along dim=0 into `[total_patches, 3, H, W]`, which matches InternVL's expectation. However:
     - `num_patches_list` is stored but not passed to the model (it's in `batch['_num_patches_list']`, but forward ignores it).
     - In distributed mode, `synchronize_multimodal_batch` (in `utils/distributed.py`) syncs batch/seq lengths but **not** `pixel_values` or `num_patches_list`, leading to inconsistencies across ranks (e.g., one rank might have mismatched visual features).
     - `get_multimodal_cot_latent_dataset` and `get_multimodal_question_latent_dataset` don't handle variable patch counts per sample during latent token insertion.
   - **Comparison to Originals**:
     - Original CoCoNuT: Text-only, so no image handling issues.
     - InternVL: Expects `pixel_values` as `[total_patches, 3, H, W]` and `num_patches_list` to split them correctly (see `InternVLChatModel.generate`).
   - **Impact**: Runtime errors (shape mismatches) in forward/generation, especially in distributed training or with variable image sizes. Visual features may be misaligned with text sequences.
   - **Fix**: 
     - Pass `num_patches_list` to model's forward/generate (add as arg in `MultimodalCoconut`).
     - In `synchronize_multimodal_batch`, broadcast `pixel_values` and `num_patches_list` across ranks.
     - In dataset functions, ensure latent token insertion doesn't disrupt image token positions (e.g., insert latents after `<IMG_CONTEXT>` blocks).

3. **Missing or Incorrect Special Token Handling in Model and Data (Integration Flaw)**:
   - **Description**: In `model/multimodal_coconut.py`, you add CoCoNuT tokens (`<|start-latent|>`, etc.) but don't resize InternVL's embeddings properly (you call `resize_token_embeddings` on `base_model.language_model`, but only if `new_vocab_size > old_vocab_size`). More critically, InternVL requires `<IMG_CONTEXT>` tokens (typically 256 per patch), but your forward pass doesn't ensure they are preserved during iterative passes. In `data/dataset.py`, tokenization inserts latents but doesn't protect image token positions, potentially corrupting visual embeddings.
   - **Comparison to Originals**:
     - Original CoCoNuT: Adds tokens to GPT-2 and resizes embeddings correctly.
     - InternVL: Dynamically replaces `<IMG_CONTEXT>` with visual features; token count must match patches.
   - **Impact**: Token ID mismatches or corrupted visual sequences in latent stages, leading to poor multimodal performance or crashes.
   - **Fix**: 
     - Always resize embeddings after adding tokens (even if size doesn't change, to initialize new embeddings).
     - In `_multimodal_forward_pass`, ensure latent replacement doesn't affect positions before image tokens.
     - Add checks in `dataset.py` to insert latents only after visual tokens.

4. **Incomplete Generation/Chat Implementation (Model Flaw)**:
   - **Description**: In `MultimodalCoconut.generate` and `chat`, you prepare multimodal embeddings but then call `base_model.language_model.generate` directly. This bypasses InternVL's full multimodal generation logic (which handles visual features in each generation step). Also, `chat` hardcodes `num_image_token = 256`, but this varies by image size/patches in InternVL.
   - **Comparison to Originals**:
     - Original CoCoNuT: Simple text generation with latent feedback.
     - InternVL: Generation integrates visual features dynamically (see `InternVLChatModel.generate`).
   - **Impact**: Generation ignores continuous thoughts for multimodal inputs, producing incoherent responses.
   - **Fix**: Implement iterative generation with latent feedback, similar to your forward pass. Use InternVL's `chat` as a base and inject CoCoNuT logic.

5. **Stage Transition and Config Mismatches in Training (Training Flaw)**:
   - **Description**: In `training/progressive_trainer.py`, you create separate trainers for 'cot' and 'coconut' modes but don't transfer model/optimizer state between them (e.g., after Stage 0, the CoCoNuT trainer starts from scratch). Config updates in `stage_manager.py` are not persisted. Also, `MultimodalCoCoNuTTrainer` assumes `coconut=True` but doesn't handle Stage 0 correctly if forced.
   - **Comparison to Originals**: CoCoNuT uses a single trainer with stage-based data prep; no explicit mode switch.
   - **Impact**: Loss of pre-training knowledge when transitioning stages, leading to suboptimal convergence.
   - **Fix**: Add state transfer (e.g., save/load checkpoint at stage boundaries). Use a single trainer class with mode switching.

### Minor Flaws (Suboptimal but Not Breaking)
These won't crash the system but may lead to poor performance or inefficiencies.

1. **Data Preparation**: `prepare_aokvqa.py` generates good multimodal data, but `dataset.py` doesn't validate image-text alignment (e.g., ensure questions match images). Original CoCoNuT has simple text validation; InternVL assumes perfect alignment.

2. **Evaluation**: `aokvqa_evaluator.py` is solid but normalizes answers simplistically. Add VQA-specific normalization (e.g., from VQA-Eval) for accuracy.

3. **Utils**: `utils/distributed.py` has good FSDP/DDP wrappers, but no multimodal-specific sharding (e.g., for large images). CoCoNuT is text-only, so this is an extension gap.

4. **Configs**: YAML files are well-structured, but `base_config.yaml` has `model_id` as InternVL3, which requires trust_remote_code‚Äîensure users know this.

### Suggestions
- **Testing**: Add unit tests for forward pass with mock multimodal inputs (e.g., dummy images + latents). Compare outputs to original CoCoNuT on text-only subsets.
- **Performance**: Profile memory in iterative passes‚Äîmultimodal KV caches could explode.
- **Enhancements**: Integrate InternVL's full chat template in your `chat` method for better conversation handling.
- **Documentation**: Add README with setup instructions, as InternVL requires specific dependencies (e.g., flash-attn).

Below is a ‚Äúred-flag review‚Äù rather than a line-by-line diff.  
I only focus on mistakes that will almost certainly prevent the model from working as intended, or that break one of the three reference implementations you asked me to compare against:

A.  Original CoCoNuT (facebookresearch/coconut)  
B.  InternVL (OpenGVLab/InternVL)  
C.  Your multimodal fork (multicoco)

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
1. Vision‚Äìtext glue: wrong mapping between <IMG_CONTEXT> tokens and patch
embeddings
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
How CoCoNuT-GPT2 works (A):
  ‚Äì No vision, so every input-id has a one-to-one embedding in the LM.

How InternVL works (B):
  ‚Äì You provide `pixel_values` plus a string that contains  
    ‚Äú\<img\> <IMG_CONTEXT> *N \<\/img\> ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù.  
  ‚Äì InternVL itself finds every <IMG_CONTEXT> position and replaces those
    token embeddings with the corresponding patch feature *in C++ code inside
    `InternVLModel.forward`*; it also needs `num_patches_list` to know how
    many patches belong to each image.

What multicoco does (C):
```
vit_embeds = base_model.extract_feature(pixel_values)     # shape = [SUM(P_i), H]
selected   = (input_ids_flat == img_context_token_id)     # len(selected) = ?
input_embeds[selected] = vit_embeds_flat                  # blind assignment
```
Fatal flaws:

  a. `vit_embeds` is concatenated across the whole batch, but
     `selected.sum()` counts tokens in *sequence order*.
     If sample-0 has 4 patches and sample-1 has 2 patches, the first
     4 selected positions may actually belong to sample-1, etc.

  b. `num_patches_list` is computed in the collator
     (`_num_patches_list`) but later thrown away; you never pass it to
     `_prepare_multimodal_embeddings` or to InternVL itself.

  c. You silently repeat / truncate visual embeddings when the counts
     do not match (catch-all `except` block).  
     That prevents a crash but completely desynchronises vision from
     text.

Result: the language model receives *patch features that belong to other
images or to no image at all*.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
2. You bypass InternVL‚Äôs own multimodal forward in the CoCoNuT loop
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
`_multimodal_forward_pass` calls  
`self.base_model.language_model(‚Ä¶)`  
instead of `self.base_model(‚Ä¶)`.

That removes:

  ‚Äì Cross-modal attention (the *whole point* of InternVL)  
  ‚Äì Vision-layer LN, Q-former, rotary embeddings, etc.  
  ‚Äì InternVL‚Äôs internal KV-cache structure (yours is now incompatible).

Consequences:
  ‚Ä¢ During the iterative latent-token passes you are feeding a *pure text-
    only* decoder; patch embeddings never flow through attention.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
3. generate() discards the CoCoNuT latent-loop
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
`MultimodalCoconut.generate()`:

  ‚Äì Builds `inputs_embeds` once, hands them to
    `base_model.language_model.generate()`, a vanilla greedy sampler.

  ‚Äì No multi-pass replacement of `<|latent|>` tokens with hidden states,
    so latent reasoning is disabled at inference time.

  ‚Äì Vision again goes through the manual ‚Äúblind assignment‚Äù path from
    bug 1 instead of InternVL‚Äôs checked path.

That means training uses your latent-loop (with bug 2, text-only) but
inference reverts to a one-shot LM ‚Üí distributional shift.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
4. Tokenizer misuse: <IMG_CONTEXT><IMG_CONTEXT> collapsed into a single ‚Äúunk‚Äù
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
`dataset.py` builds
```
img_context_tokens = '<IMG_CONTEXT>' * num_patches
question_with_image = f'<img>{img_context_tokens}</img>\n{question}'
```
There are no delimiters, so the string becomes
`"<img><IMG_CONTEXT><IMG_CONTEXT><IMG_CONTEXT>..."` which
Tokenizer-InternVL sees as *one unknown token*, not N tokens.  
The downstream `selected` mask in bug 1 therefore almost always equals 0
and visual tokens never get replaced.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
5. Shape contracts: pixel_values expected as
   [B, P, C, H, W] by InternVL but collator outputs
   torch.cat(patch_list) ‚Üí [Œ£P, C, H, W]
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
InternVL‚Äôs `extract_feature` needs one image per **outer** dimension to
derive positional ids.  
By concatenating along batch-0 you produce a single ‚Äúmega-image‚Äù with
Œ£P patches.  Positional encodings, CLS selection and `img_context_token_id`
all become invalid.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
6. Continuous-thought loop uses hidden_state (t-1) but not visual context
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Even if bug 1‚Äì5 were fixed, CoCoNuT‚Äôs latent algorithm should feed the
hidden vector that came *after text+vision attention*, not the LM-only
vector currently produced by `language_model(...)`.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
7. Special-token bookkeeping inconsistent
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
You add special tokens **twice** in different places:

  ‚Äì run.py adds with `tokenizer.add_tokens(...)`  
  ‚Äì create_multimodal_coconut_model adds again with
    `tokenizer.add_tokens(...)`

If someone loads the model via the helper first and then runs run.py the
token ids shift, breaking every checkpoint.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
8. Stage-0 (CoT) training still writes `<|latent|>` tokens
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
`get_multimodal_cot_latent_dataset(... no_special_marker=True)` puts
`n_latent_tokens = effective_stage * c_thought`, but `effective_stage`
is forced to 0 only before the uniform-mixing branch.  
Because uniform mixing is on by default (0.1) you *will* insert latent
tokens during what should be plain-text CoT training‚Äîdirectly
contradicting the curriculum described in the paper.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
9. DDP/FSDP initialisation is unsafe
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
`setup_fsdp_model` calls `torch.cuda.current_device()` **before**
`torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)` is executed in many launch scripts.
Result: rank 0 grabs GPU-0, rank 1 also tries to grab GPU-0 ‚áí RuntimeError
on multi-GPU nodes.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
10. Debug-print statements in forward pass break TorchScript / AMP
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
`print(f"DEBUG: ... {tensor}")` inside the hot path forces host-device
synchronisation and kills any chance of TorchScript compilation or
mixed-precision speed-ups.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
How to fix (minimal set)

1.  Stop reinventing InternVL‚Äôs embedding logic.  
    In every forward / generate call simply do  
    `return self.base_model(pixel_values=..., input_ids=..., ...)` and
    let InternVL handle the replacement.

2.  Keep `num_patches_list` throughout the dataloader ‚Üí forward path and
    pass it to InternVL.

3.  Build image strings exactly as InternVL expects:  
    `" <img> " + " ".join(["<IMG_CONTEXT>"]*num_patches) + " </img> "`  
    (white-space matters!).

4.  Re-implement the CoCoNuT latent loop *around*
    `self.base_model` rather than around `self.base_model.language_model`
    so that every pass includes cross-modal attention.

5.  During inference wrap `self.generate` with exactly the same
    latent-token iterative logic (otherwise training / test mismatch).

6.  Add delimiter guards so special tokens are added once and only once.

7.  Turn `uniform_prob` off (0.0) during Stage-0 or guard it with
    `if scheduled_stage > 0`.

8.  Replace all `print` debugging inside `forward` with Python-logging
    conditioned on `if self.debug` flags.

9.  In distributed setup: after `torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)`
    call `setup_multimodal_distributed_model`.
